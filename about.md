Hi, my name is Shun-Lung Chang (張舜龍), or you can call me Conner.

I am now working as an data analyst, and adept at python and R programming. To be more specific, I am able to build web crawlers and perform text mining through python. For data cleaning and visualization, I use R more often. Besides, for data analyzing and modeling, I am able to use the python package scikit-learn and R packages to constuct a satisfactory data model and interpret its results.

Furthermore, I have studied how to analyze data on a distributed computing platform (especially on Spark). Also, I am highly interested in Docker, which helps me to build a productive development environment in a speedy manner.

I would write my posts either in Taiwan Madarian or English, if you want to correct mistakes or resolve ambiguity in my posts, feel free to contact me. You email me, I would be grateful for your comments and corrections.
